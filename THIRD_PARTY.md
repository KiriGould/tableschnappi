## Runtime dependencies

Installed from their upstream registries, not vendored. Exact resolved
versions for everything the containers run are pinned in `package-lock.json`
and the compiled `requirements.txt` files under `packages/`. The two
workshop input files — `workshop/requirements-notebooks.in` and
`requirements-pipeline.in` — are **not** compiled: they are installed into a
workbench interactively and carry loose ranges on purpose.

Notable, by component:

- **Assistant** (`packages/mlflow-proxy`): MLflow (Apache-2.0), LangChain and
  LangGraph (MIT), FastAPI (MIT), uvicorn (BSD-3-Clause), httpx
  (BSD-3-Clause), OpenAI Python SDK (Apache-2.0). With
  `INCLUDE_GARAK=true` it also pulls NVIDIA garak (Apache-2.0) and PyTorch
  (BSD-3-Clause), the latter from the PyTorch CPU index.
- **Backend** (`packages/backend`): Express (MIT), Socket.IO (MIT).
- **MCP server** (`packages/mcp-server`): Model Context Protocol SDK (MIT),
  zod (MIT).
- **Frontend** (`packages/frontend`): React and react-router-dom (MIT),
  socket.io-client (MIT), react-markdown (MIT), **lucide-react (ISC)**,
  Tailwind CSS, Vite and PostCSS (MIT).
- **Workshop** (`workshop/`): kfp (Apache-2.0), Docling (MIT), transformers
  (Apache-2.0), pandas and numpy (BSD-3-Clause), matplotlib (PSF-style),
  seaborn (BSD-3-Clause), plotly (MIT), ipywidgets (BSD-3-Clause),
  fpdf2 (LGPL-3.0, used as an unmodified dependency only).

Everything above is permissively licensed except fpdf2 (LGPL-3.0), which is
used unmodified as a dependency, and the base images below.

Container base images carry their own distribution licences:
`node:20-alpine` and `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged` (Alpine/BusyBox, GPL-2.0),
`python:3.11-slim` (Debian userland), `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311`
(Red Hat UBI terms).

## Documentation references

Red Hat OpenShift AI product documentation informed the EvalHub REST API
usage in `workshop/06_evalhub_native.ipynb`. API endpoints, payload shapes and
header names are interface facts; no documentation prose is reproduced here.

## Original content

The adversarial prompts in `packages/frontend/src/components/AttackDemo.tsx`
were written for this project. They exercise well-known injection techniques,
but the wording is original and stays in the restaurant domain. No third-party
jailbreak corpus is reproduced.

`workshop/sekki_data.py` — seasonal descriptions and haiku written for this
project (LLM-assisted). Fictional demo content for a fictional restaurant; the
`health_wisdom` entries are not culinary or medical advice.
